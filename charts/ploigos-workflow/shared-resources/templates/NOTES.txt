Dependencies
------------
The ServiceAccount installed by this chart also installs a namespaced RoleBinding which
assumes the existence of a ClusterRole ({{ .Values.global.workflowWorkerRunnerRoleName }})
which has access to a SecurityContextConstraint (or similar) to be able to run containers
with the SETUID and SETGID container capabilities.

Having a cluster administrator install the ploigos-workflow-shared-cluster-resources chart
will satisfy these dependencies.

Installed
---------
* Workflow ServiceAccount: {{ include "ploigos-workflow.workflowServiceAccountName" . }}
* Workflow ServiceAccount RoleBinding:
  - name: {{ include "ploigos-workflow.workflowServiceAccountName" . }}
  - Target ClusterRole: {{ .Values.global.workflowWorkerRunnerRoleName }}
* PGP Keys Secret: {{ include "ploigos-workflow.pgpKeysSecretName" . }}
