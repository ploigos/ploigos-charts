# workflowWorkerRunAsUser is the UID of the user to run the containers as in the ClusterTasks
# Optional.
#
# If given then all ClusterTasks created by this chart will be hard coded to run as this user.
# If 'rbacCreate' is also true then ClusterRole and SecurityContextConstraints will be created
# for this UID as well.
#
# If not given then all ClusterTasks created by this chart will run as whatever UID
# the Kubernetes platform they run on assigns them.

# rbacCreate if true and workflowWorkerRunAsUser is provided  then chart will create ClusterRole and
# SecurityContextConstraints for the given workflowWorkerRunAsUser UID, else if false then ClusterRole
# and SecurityContextConstraints will not be created even if workflowWorkerRunAsUser is specified leaving it
# to another process to create the appropriate RBAC resources.
